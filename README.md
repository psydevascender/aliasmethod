# Alias Method Sampler in C++

This project implements the **Alias Method** for fast sampling from a discrete probability distribution in **O(1)** time. 
It is a common technique used in simulations, games, and probabilistic modeling.

## Features

- Fast sampling using the Alias Method
- Proper handling of edge cases and floating-point precision
- Full bounds-checking and crash safety
- Modern C++17 code with `std::vector`, `std::random`, and `std::clamp`

## Build Instructions

Make sure you have a C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`), then run:

```bash
make
